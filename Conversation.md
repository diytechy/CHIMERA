Perform a deep review of "C:\Projects\ORIGEN2\.scripts\resolve_samplers.py" and create a plan to clean up, simplify, and consolidate functions and code where reasonable.  Also integrate the following changes:
1. The output file ("resolved_samplers.yml") should have repeated samplers defined as anchors, so they can subsequently be referred to using anchors in dependent samplers (not repeating samplers over and over again through different trees.)
2. Completely overwrite the "resolved_samplers.yml" only with samplers that are discovered through the sampler chain processing.

Add 5 parameters to customization.yml related to continental construction that describe:
1. What threshold the continental_sampler must be below for islands to appear.
2. What threshold the continental_sampler must exceed or standard continents to appear.
3. What threshold the continental_sampler must exceed for lakes to appear.
4. The maximum ratio that an island can have compared to the continental maximum (0 to 1)
5. The maximum ratio that a lake can have compared to the continental minimum (0 to 1)

Then in continents.yml, update the "continental_landmass" to incorperate the new parameters and output:
A 0 to 1 value for continents
0 to {maximum island ratio} for islands (when continents sampler value is below the island threshold)
0 to -1 for oceans
0 to -{maximum lake ratio} for lakes (when continents sampler value is above a the lake threshold)


Now that "resolved_samplers.yml" has been built, make a plan to create another python script that performs the following:

- Detects identical samplers that are used more than 3 times.
that runs against the resolved_samplers.yml



Review "resolved_samplers.yml" and identify all samplers
