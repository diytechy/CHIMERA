> This pack is still in a testing phase, so bugs and issues are to be expected

An overworld configuration pack for minecraft 1.21 and terra 7.0 and higher. It is based on the default Terra overworld config pack v2.0, which you can find 
[here](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraOverworldConfig/tree/2.0). A lot of content is used from the default pack, especially regarding the terrain features such as trees, flora and palettes.

Origen focuses on adding a new and more creative / diverse terrain generation, without using any new blocks or items. This means that it is compatible with vanilla installations.

You can find Terra - the main project this config pack is designed for
[here](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra).

Huge thanks to everyone on the Terra Discord that has helped with my countless questions and with giving feedback. Most notably to Astrash and Aureus, without them this pack wouldn't have made it anywhere.  Some of the screenshots are taken with the [Bare Bones texture pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bare-bones).

Most top level settings, such as biome and river sizes, can be found in the file [customization.yml](customization.yml).

## Installation

Origen is just a config pack for the Terra mod. Make sure you have Terra installed first. You can find it on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/terra). 

You can grab the latest release from the Github [releases section](https://github.com/Rearth/Origen/releases/latest), from there just download the origen-v\*.\*.\*.zip file, and copy it to your Terra pack directory. For more information on installing Terra config packs, see the [docs here](https://terra.polydev.org/config/pack-installation.html).

## Biome distribution

Considerable effort has been invested in ensuring that biomes are renderer in the desired size and shape. This enables the design of landform features within biomes of relatively specific dimensions, while also preventing the terrain itself from becoming overly large, small, or distorted.

At a fundamental level, biomes are established using cellular noise, resulting in a uniform size and shape for most biomes. These cellular units are subsequently categorized into land and ocean cells, determined by a continental value situated at the center of each cell. This approach ensures that land cells adjacent to oceans maintain their full size, without being truncated at the point where the "continental" equation would transition into ocean cells. This principle is also extended to ocean biomes.

The identification and placement of coastal biomes involve utilizing the boundary between ocean and land cells. Subsequently, the coastal areas are divided into discrete units using a distinct seed. Furthermore, coastal zones are classified into three categories: none, narrow, and wide. This results in some coastlines either being absent altogether (e.g. the ocean directly borders land biomes) or being categorized as narrow or significantly wider.

Rivers are added throughout all biomes tagged with "USE_RIVER". These rivers are generally broader and deeper than standard vanilla rivers, allowing smoother boat navigation. Certain biomes also feature river variants, often generating rivers that meander through cavernous sections of large mountains, thus negating the need for the river to cut entirely through these substantial landforms.

## Currently available biomes

Here is a full list of all biomes used in Origen. Note that some biomes are already included in the default terra overworld config pack, and will be marked as such.

**Jungle Sinkhole**

Contains a warm surface with big jungle trees covering it.

**Forest Sinkhole**

Contains mossy stone walls and a diverse mix of trees covering the bottom of the sinkhole.

**Frozen Sinkhole**

Cold version of the sinkhole. Has a snowy surface with ice spikes on it.

** TODO **

## Navigating through the config

This pack is organized into many top level directories, each containing configs
specific to a different domain of configuration:

- `biomes`
  Where all biome configs are defined.

- `biome-distribution`
  Contains configuration files related *where* biomes generate.

- `structures`
  Where all files loaded as structures are stored. (This includes things like
  trees, boulders, flower patches, etc.)

- `features`
  Where all feature configs go - These determine *how structures are
  generated in the world.*

- `palettes`
  Contains all palette configs - These are used by biomes to determine what
  blocks make up the base terrain.

- `math`
  Common mathematical functions used in the pack as well as generic noise
  samplers are defined here.

- `*/rearth/`
  Completely new content that has been added, which is not available in the default config pack. These subfolders are where you'll find most of the new stuff.

For more in-depth explanations of each directory's files and subdirectories, you
can refer to their respective README files.

## Customization

### How do I make biomes larger / smaller?

You can find some easy to modify parameters in the [`meta.yml`](./meta.yml) file
under `biome-distribution`, which control the scales of different areas of biome
distribution.

### How do I remove all oceans / all land / all hot biomes / etc?

This pack comes with several biome distribution presets, which can be chosen
within the [`pack.yml`](./pack.yml) file. If none of these presets do exactly
what you want, you can further modify biome distribution presets with alternate
sources and stages. Check out the
[`biome-distribution/presets/default.yml`](./biome-distribution/presets/default.yml)
config for these alternative sources and stages.

### Where can I learn more about configuration?

If you want more in-depth customization, or simply just want to know what makes
this pack tick, you can check out the
[config development](https://terra.polydev.org/config/development/index.html)
section of the Terra wiki to learn more.
